                "a. Commander’s Intent. The Sultan's forces are to attack with all their fury and clear compound to compound to root out the Al-Shahid threat.  None will be shown mercy, as they are to be executed for treason should they be captured.  Any foreign soldiers found in our territory are considered hostile, and you may defend yourselves against them.  However, it is imperative that we identify the foreign government operatives in the province so that we may be better equipped to fight them.  Capturing one of these advisors is a top priority, and they should be immediately turned over to the Commando Regiment or the Americans.<br/><br/>b. Concept of Operations. The Sultan’s warriors are to concentrate on re-capturing the province’s three largest cities, Bahijah, Dilshad, and Kallista.  After which, we will sweep through the rest of the province's smaller settlements ridding ourselves of the Al-Shahid scourge.  Use extreme caution when conducting operations in the Southeast portion of the province.  Intelligence suggests it is that area in which the foreign devil government is most concentrated.<br/><br/>c. Maneuvers. The Sultan’s forces are to make use of their speed and firepower armored vehicles when attacking across open open terrain and to use them in conjunction with dismounted elements when entering urban environments.  Al-Shahid is dug deep into the province’s mountains, therefore dismounted operations to root out the traitors may be necessary where the armored vehicles cannot go.<br/><br/>d. Coordinating Instructions. The Royal Commando Regiment is to coordinate with the Americans in order to gather intelligence on Al-Shahid and the unknown government.  Intelligence gathered by the Americans will be passed on to the Commandos and then on to the Frontier Regiment.  It is vital that the American’s remain as covert as possible.  We do not want the Sultan looking weak by accepting help from infidels."

                "1. Situation",
                "The terrorist organization Al-Shahid has organized a widespread revolt within the southeastern province of the Sultanate of Reshmaan.  It is suspected that the revolt was orchestrated by a foreign government power, as Al-Shahid  took the Sultanate by surprise by using equipment and training it would not otherwise acquired without help.  Local security forces were quickly overwhelmed and defeated and the province fell into complete control of Al-Shahad, with the exception of the northern airfield, which remains in grave danger of being overrun.  NATO and the UN cannot or will not intervene on the behalf of the Sultanate due to political pressure of China and Russia.  Earlier this month, both China and Russia vetoed a UN Security Council Resolution which would have deployed a peacekeeping force to the province to restore order.  Abandoned by the international community, the His Royal Highness the Sultan of Reshmaan fears that the revolt may spread to the rest of the Sultanate and depose His Highness from his throne.  His Royal Highness has authorized the deployment of the Sultan’s Royal Frontier Regiment and the Sultan’s Royal Commando Regiment to the province in order to defeat Al-Shahid and any foreign military that may be supporting the revolt.  United States President Donald Trump, frustrated with the international community’s unwillingness to act, has decided to deploy a covert CIA SAD/SOG element in order and support the Sultanate of Reshmaan in these endeavors.<br/><br/>a. Enemy Forces:<br/><br/>Al-Shahid:<br/><br/>(1) Background: Al-Shahid is led the terrorist Mohammed Al-Bahar.  At the start of the revolt, the group took local security forces by surprise and overwhelmed them using superior firepower and numbers.  They have instilled their own strict version of Sharia and control the province through fear, intimidation, and murder.<br/><br/>(2) Capabilities: Al-Shahid appears to have somehow acquired a large number of soviet era vehicles and weaponry, raising suspicion of foreign involvement in the revolt.  They have been observed utilizing T-72s and T-55s and several variants of BMPs and BTRs.<br/><br/>(3) Most Probable Course of Action: Al-Shahid will likely utilize both conventional and unconventional attacks against the Sultan’s forces.   Expect them to carry out IED and VBIED attacks as well as suicide attacks.  They will also attempt to overwhelm friendly forces with superior numbers and firepower using the equipment they have acquired.<br/><br/>Unknown Foreign Government:<br/><br/>(1) Background: The equipment and training of Al-Shahid points to the involvement of a foreign government orchestrating the revolt against the Sultanate.  Foreign enemy soldiers, both special forces and regular, have been observed advising and even leading Ah-Shahid militants.  The southern outpost reports to have directly attacked by what appeared to regular foreign soldiers before communications were cut off.<br/><br/>(2) Capabilities: Sporadic flights of unidentified foreign aircraft, both fixed wing and rotary wing, have been observed flying over the province.  Armored vehicles, operating in conjunction with what appears to be foreign regular army soldiers, has also been observed in convoys crossings over the southern border into the province.  There is no more information available.<br/><br/>(3) Most Probable Course of Action: The unknown foreign government appears to be operating most heavily in the south eastern part of the province.  In the north, they have mainly been observed refraining from engaging in direct combat and instead have been seen advising the Al-Shahid militants.  It is difficult to further predict the foreign government’s most probable course of action due to the limited knowledge of the government’s identity and intentions.<br/><br/>b. Friendly Forces - Task Force Revolver:<br/><br/>His Majesty the Sultan of Reshmaan’s Royal Frontier Regiment (Spearhead Reserve Forces)<br/><br/>The Royal Frontier Regiment (RFR) is a mechanized regiment of the Sultan’s Royal Army.  Equipped with M113 APCs and supported by M1A1 Abrams, the Frontier Regiment is trained to utilize speed, firepower, and armored protection to close with and destroy the enemy through mechanized and armored tactics.  They are the front line soldiers in the Sultan’s campaign to rid the sultanate of the heretics that encroach on our lands.<br/><br/>His Majesty the Sultan of Reshmaan’s Royal Commando Regiment (Spearhead Land Forces)<br/><br/>The Royal Commando Regiment are the Sultan’s elite special forces.  Trained by the American’s and the British, they are equipped with the latest weaponry the sultanate has to offer.  They are deployed with lightly protected but heavily armed landrovers which gives them the speed and firepower to carry out hit and run attacks against the traitors  They are the only group with has direct knowledge of the Americans’ CIA involvement in Reshmaan and maintains a direct link with them in order to share intelligence.<br/><br/>His Majesty the Sultan of Reshmaan’s Royal Air Force Regiment (Spearhead Air Forces)<br/><br/>The RAFR has been deployed to the province in order to provide fixed and rotary wing support for the RFR and RCR.  It is authorized to engage and shoot down any foreign unidentified aircraft flying within the province.  They are to make us of the UH-1H variants provided to it as well as the latest military technology that the Sultan has acquired, the AW101 Merlin and the F-16 Fighting Falcon.<br/><br/>CIA Special Activities Division / Special Operations Group (Spearhead Special Operations Forces)<br/><br/>United States President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of CIA SAD/SOG elements to Reshmaan in order to combat the growing Al-Shahid and foreign government threat.  The SAD group is authorized to covertly collect intelligence on the enemy forces and to assist Royal Land Forces operations within the province."
